      <h3>Booking & Quotes</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I get a quote?</summary>
        <p>Use <a href="/book-now/">Book Now</a>. As you choose your service and enter details (area, rooms, extras), you’ll see an estimated price (when enabled). You’ll receive confirmation by email after submitting.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What services do you offer?</summary>
        <p>Commercial (Office, Gym, Medical, Child Care, Pub, Strata, Post-Construction) and Residential (Regular/Deep, End-of-Lease, Laundry/Fold/Iron). If you don’t see your exact scenario, choose the closest and add notes in “Other requirements”.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I book from my phone?</summary>
        <p>Yes. The booking flow is mobile-first and takes a few minutes.</p>

      <h3>Pricing & Estimates</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>How is pricing calculated?</summary>
        <p>Each service has a base price plus modifiers (e.g., area in sqm, number of rooms, add-ons). Recurring bookings can receive frequency discounts (weekly, fortnightly, monthly). Final pricing is confirmed after reviewing your details and access.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer packages or discounts?</summary>
        <p>Yes—recurring schedules may receive discounts. Package bundles (e.g., windows, oven, carpet add-ons) can be included in your booking notes for a combined quote.</p>

      <details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to be home?</summary>

      <details>
        <summary>Is parking required?</summary>
